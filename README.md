# Hospital-Management-System
🏥 Initial commit: Hospital Management System (v0.1 - Alpha)

This is the first working version of a hospital management system written in C.
The project is under active development and may contain bugs.

✨ Implemented Features:
  • Patient registration with detailed information
  • Doctor appointment booking system (22 doctors, 19 specialties)
  • Patient search by ID number
  • Basic file saving functionality
  • Interactive menu system with while loop
  • Input validation (gender, age, etc.)

🚧 Work in Progress:
  • File loading/reading functionality
  • Patient update and delete operations
  • Enhanced file operations (append mode)
  • Statistics and reporting features
  • Date/time system for appointments

🐛 Known Issues:
  • Gender field not included in file save operation
  • File mode should be "a" (append) instead of "w" (write)
  • Memory management needs optimization
  • No file loading on program start

🛠️ Technical Stack:
  • Language: C
  • Libraries: stdio.h, stdlib.h, string.h, ctype.h
  • Data Structures: Structs, Dynamic Memory (malloc)
  • File Operations: fprintf, fopen, fclose

📚 Learning Goals:
  • Practice C programming fundamentals
  • Understand file I/O operations
  • Work with structs and pointers
  • Implement dynamic memory allocation
  • Build a real-world application

Next steps: Fix file operations, implement data persistence, add CRUD operations.
